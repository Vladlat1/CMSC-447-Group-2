see [Tutorial](https://blog.miguelgrinberg.com/post/the-flask-mega-tutorial-part-iii-web-forms)

* This was the tutorial that was originally followed at the start of the project in order to develop a basic understanding of Flask and web development.
* It was left off at part III, and then we developed it on our own from there.
